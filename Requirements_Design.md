# LinkedIn Relationship Program

This Program gives us a visually graph of relationships between connection with many hierachy structures such as companies, HRs, employers and employees, testimonials and referrals,... many kinds of entities. I am going to simulate the system under java OOP program and data structure concepts.

## Concepts are going to have on this project

- OOP: `encapsulation`, `polymorphism`, `abstraction` and `inheritance`
- Tree: Advanced tree implementation such as (2-4) tree.
- Hash Map
- Array index-based and Array Linked List

### Big-O expectations
- Listing all employees: O(n).
- Looking for an employee in a company: O(1), worst case O(n) by using hash map
- Looking up for employees according to hierachy in the company: O(n log n) using tree implementation.
